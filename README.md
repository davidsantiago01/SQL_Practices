# SQL_Subqueries Practice

### Project Overview 
To put in practice basic essentials from SQL (Select, where, from, group by, subqueries)

### Tools
- SQLite

### Data Sources
The primary database used for this analysis is Nortwind Sales tables containing 9 tables with different information (Categories, Customers, Employees, OrderDetails, Orders, Products, Shippers, Suppliers, sqLite_sequence)

The goal of this practice is to determine the top sales employees whose sales exceeded the average, and bottom sales employees whose sales did not exceeded the average

Here is the consult which leaded to get the top employees.

As for the bottom employees, I just simply flip the < sign to indicate SQL where to get the reference to compare when total sales were less than the total sales average for each employee.
